  /**
   * All of the code for your public-facing JavaScript source
   * should reside in this file.
   *
   * Note: It has been assumed you will write jQuery code here, so the
   * $ function reference has been prepared for usage within the scope
   * of this function.
   *
   * This enables you to define handlers, for when the DOM is ready:
   *
   * $(function() {
   *
   * });
   *
   * When the window is loaded:
   *
   * $( window ).on('load', function() {
   *
   * });
   *
   * ...and/or other possibilities.
   *
   * Ideally, it is not considered best practice to attach more than a
   * single DOM-ready or window-load handler for a particular page.
   * Although scripts in the WordPress core, Plugins and Themes may be
   * practising this, we should strive to set a better example in our own work.
